## Summary (taken from the sight store page)

Sight is a game that uses the "line of sight" mechanism also used in Meridians.

Players place their pieces on the available intersection, and if there is friendly pieces on the "line of sight" of this placement, another pieces are placed on top of those pieces to form stacks.

If the player already has their own stacks at the beginning of their turn, then must move a piece from the top of the stack to the next available intersection, without placing a new piece. The player who has no legal move loses the game.

## Detailed rules (taken from the sight game rules)

Sight is a game that can be played on the Alquerque board, with the "line of sight" mechanism. Depending on the position on the board, players use two types of actions: placement and movement of pieces, with the objective of eliminating their opponent's legal moves.

### SETUP

Use the Alquerque board with 5x5 intersections. The board is initially empty. Each player decides in any appropriate way which colors to use.

### DEFINITIONS

In this game, a "stack" is two or more pieces of the same color stacked together. A singleton piece is not a stack.

Two pieces on the board are "visible" or "in line of sight" of each other if they are on the same grid line with no other pieces between them. Pieces adjacent to each other on the grid lines are also visible to each other.

### GAMEPLAY

The White player moves first, and alternates turns. On your turn, you must perform one of the following actions, depending on the condition of the board:

#### A - When there is no stack of your color on the board

Place a piece of your color on the empty intersection. If there is a friendly piece in the line of sight of the placed piece, add a piece of your own color from your hand to all of them to make two-height stacks.

#### B - When there are stacks of your color on the board

From one of your stacks, the topmost piece is moved to the adjacent empty intersection. If there are multiple stacks, the highest stack has priority. If there is no difference in height, the active player may choose.

If there are pieces or stacks of the same color in the line of sight of the moved piece, add your pieces from your hand to all of them to add height. The piece or stack from which the move originated is unaffected.

### GAME END

A player who has no legal moves on his or her turn loses the game. This includes the case when all intersections of the board are filled with pieces/stacks at the beginning of the turn.
